Notes that although these prescriptions may vary significantly, they all tend to argue that their way is the ``one best way'' for all organizations. Challenges the idea that there can be a ``one best way'' and instead seeks to replace prescription with choice. Begins by reviewing the two main models of change - the planned and emergent approaches - before moving on to discuss the merits of adopting a contingency model of change. However, argues that such an approach does not offer real choice: instead it merely seeks to replace one set of prescriptions with another. Concludes by calling for a recognition that organizations do have real choices in what they change and how they change it.},

Recent technological advances have allowed neuroscience to flourish, alongside growing romanticism that reductionist studies will allow us to understand complex interpersonal behaviours. Organizational cognitive neuroscience and neuroleadership are newly established interdisciplinary fields that use neuroscientific techniques to answer questions about behaviours within organizations. Neuroleadership aims to discover screening tools for good leaders, to improve leadership skills, and to identify unconscious factors affecting behaviour in hopes of improving management and leadership practices. Although proponents of neuroleadership are optimistic, if we know anything about the functions of the human brain and our interpersonal behaviours, it is that they are exquisitely complex and context dependant. Here, we briefly discuss the major themes emerging in the new field of neuroleadership and the limitations and potential consequences of applying findings from the field prematurely and with blind optimism.},

  abstract = {Several provocative studies on organizational neuroscience have been published of late, many in the domain of leadership. These studies are motivated by the prospect of being able to better explain what causes and constitutes `good' leadership by examining brain activity. In so doing, these studies follow an established path in organizational research that seeks to reduce complex social phenomena to more basic (neurological) processes. However, advocates of organizational neuroscience reveal very little about the fundamental problems and challenges of reductionism. Therefore, our aim in this article is to scrutinize the reductionist assumptions and processes underlying the fast-evolving domain of organizational neuroscience as it is applied to the study of leadership. We maintain that without explicit consideration of, and solutions to, the challenges of reductionism, the possibilities to advance leadership studies theoretically and empirically are limited. In consequence, inferential ambiguities that flow from such insights run the danger of informing organizational practice inadequately. Thus, we find suggestions that we are at the brink of a neuroscientific revolution in the study of leadership premature, and a sole focus on neuroscience, at the expense of insights from other social science disciplines, dangerous.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Change can be bewildering, alarming, exhausting and risky but at the same time efficacious, productive, beneficial, and salutary. In the current, ever evolving work dynamics, change is the only constant. So, managing change is very important when it comes to any organisation. It is an inevitable process for both individuals and organizations. The main purpose of this study is to understand and analyze the impact of organizational agility in change management process for a successful transition. ~ Theoretical Framework: To keep pace with the demands of ever-changing technology, competition, and other socio-economic factors, it has become very important for organizations to act with agility when a change occurs. Moreover because of the current competitive trends, the main shift can be seen towards the agile paradigm. In our current expeditious work environment, it has become difficult to adopt and function with an existing change model with many steps. ~ Design/Methodology/Approach: Secondary data analysis method is used, which involves a thorough exploratory search of existing data available at varied sources.~ For the review and evaluation, content analysis was carried out for 115 manuscripts to exclude the irrelevant ones. But after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 62 papers were selected and analysed, considering time frame, objectives, and related information. ~ Findings: Organizational agility helps in undertaking change in a faster way as it equips employees with required knowledge and skills to efficaciously navigate change, adapting them to thrive in rapid changing environment. Organizational change agility is the unification of organizational operations, attributes and employees using advanced technology. ~ Research, Practical and Social Implications: The study identifies the importance of agility in change management for a successful transition in any organizations. Though change management is a well-studied subject, the success rate of any change process remains low. Incorporating agility can help in overcoming many crucial problems faced by organizations due to its flexibility, transparency, speed, and proper training. ~ Originality / Value:~This study is an inventive attempt to enhance the management practices in relation to change management of organizations, by incorporating agility factor. The findings may help and encourage organizations to consider these agility components and variables while adopting any transformation model for a successful change.},

This paper aims to analyse the role of neuroleadership in the application of happiness management. Two research questions are proposed: what do we know about neuroleadership? and what role can neuroleadership play in happiness management? A mixed methodology is applied. A bibliometric technique is used to identify the main topics studied in neuroleadership. An in-depth analysis and logical reasoning are applied to propose a neuroleadership research roadmap and to present some research pathways for neuroleadership for happiness management. A neuroleadership research roadmap is proposed, considering the approaches, practices/actions, and purposes. It is observed that the consideration of the management of emotions and cognitive processes in the work environment is attracting interest to develop a leadership focused on making better workplaces. A new line of action focused on the management of happiness is emerging. In addition, neuroleadership is presented as a new way of understanding management. Their combined application can mark a before and after in business management, and for that, a proposal of future research lines and questions is developed. This paper presents four future research pathways---perspectives, reasons, adoption and implementation, and results---for studying neuroleadership for happiness management.},
