  abstract = {Currently 99.8\% of global transport is powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) and 95\% of transport energy comes from liquid fuels made from petroleum. Many alternatives including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and other fuels like biofuels and hydrogen are being considered. However, all these alternatives start from a very low base and face very significant barriers to unlimited expansion so that 85--90\% of transport energy is expected to come from conventional liquid fuels powering combustion engines even by 2040. Hence it is imperative that ICEs are improved in order to reduce the local and global environmental impact of transport. This paper considers the scope for such improvement after discussing the basic principles that govern engine efficiency and the technologies to control exhaust pollution. The great scope for such improvement is illustrated by considering various practical approaches already in the market. For instance, the best in class SI engines in the U.S. have 14\% lower fuel consumption compared to the average. Engine and conventional powertrain developments alone could reduce the fuel consumption by over 30\% for light duty vehicles (LDVs). Implementing other technologies such as hybridisation and light-weighting could reduce fuel consumption by 50\% compared to the current average for LDVs. Current after-treatment technology can ensure that the exhaust pollutant levels meet the most stringent current emissions requirements. Indeed, with the most modern diesel vehicles, the exhaust can be cleaner than the intake air in urban centres. The implications for transport policy, particularly where there are plans to ban ICEs, are considered in the final discussion. All available technologies need to be deployed to mitigate the environmental impact of transport and it would be extremely short-sighted to discourage further development of ICEs by limiting their sales.},

  abstract = {This study is an experimental investigation of the effect of bioethanol gasoline blending on exhaust emissions in terms of carbon dioxide CO2, carbon monoxide CO, unburnt hydrocarbons UHC, and nitric oxide NOx of a spark ignition engine. Tests are conducted at controlled throttle and variable speed condition over the range of 1200 to 2000 rpm with intervals 400 rpm. Different compression ratios are tested for each speed, namely (7,8,10, and 11). Pure gasoline and bioethanol gasoline blends are used. The bioethanol used is produced from Iraqi date crop (Zehdi). Blending is done on energy replacement bases. Ethanol energy ratio (EER) used is 5\%, 10\%, and 15\%. At each of the three designated engine speeds, the torque is set as 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 N{$\cdot$}m. It is found that ethanol blending reduces CO and UHC concentration in the exhaust gases by about 45\% and 40.15\%, respectively, and increases NOx and CO2 concentrations in the exhaust gases by about 16.18\% and 7.5\%, respectively. It is found also that load and speed increase causes an increase in CO2 and NOx concentrations and reduces CO and UHC concentrations. It is also found that increasing the compression ratio causes the emissions of CO2 and NOx to decrease and those of CO and UHC to increase.},

  abstract = {Introduction Ignition timing, in a spark ignition engine, is the process of setting the time that an ignition will occur in the combustion chamber (during the compression stroke) relative to piston position and crankshaft angular velocity. Setting the correct ignition timing is crucial in the performance and exhaust emissions of an engine.The objective of the present work is to evaluate whether variable ignition timing can be effect on exhaust emission and engine performance of an SI engine. Method For achieving this goal, at a speed of 3400 rpm, the ignition timing has been changed in the range of 41{$^\circ$} BTDC to 10{$^\circ$} ATDC and for optimize operation, ignition timing has been designed at wide-open throttle and at last, the performance characteristics such as power, torque, BMEP, volumetric efficiency and emissions are obtained and discussed. Results The results show optimal power and torque is achieved at 31{$^\circ$}CA before top dead centre and volumetric efficiency, BMEP have increased with rising ignition timing. O2, CO2, CO has been almost constant, but HC with advance of ignition timing increased and the lowest amount NOx is obtained at 10 BTDC. Conclusions In conclusion, it obtained that ignition timing can be used as an alternative way for predicting the performance of internal combustion engines. Also engine speed and throttle position were all found to significantly influence performance in this engine.},
